# Chapter 4: Communicating with OpenAI

In this section of the workshop, we'll dive into the Nest.js application that interacts with OpenAI's API to enhance your Angular documentation with AI-driven search capabilities. We'll focus on the [app.service.ts](../apps/ai-api/src/app/app.service.ts) file, which is the heart of our application, handling the logic for processing user queries and fetching relevant documentation sections.

## Understanding the Structure

The [app.service.ts](../apps/ai-api/src/app/app.service.ts) file contains a service class that defines methods for handling various tasks, such as creating embeddings for user queries, searching for matching documentation sections, and generating responses using OpenAI's API.
